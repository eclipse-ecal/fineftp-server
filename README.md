# fineFTP Server

FineFTP is a minimal FTP server library for Windows and Unix flavors. The project is CMake based and only depends on asio, which is integrated as git submodule. No boost is required.

You can easily embed this library into your own project in order to create an embedded FTP Server. It was developed and tested on Windows 10 (Visual Studio 2015 and newer, MinGW) and Ubuntu 18.04 - 22.04 (gcc 7.4.0 - 11.2.0). It should also run fine on macOS.

## Dependencies

- [asio](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio)

## Features

- FTP Passive mode (the only mode you need nowadays)
- Listing directories
- Uploading and downloading files
- Creating and removing files and directories
- User authentication (and anonymous user without authentication)
- Individual local home path for each user
- Access control on a per-user-basis
- UTF8 support (On Windows MSVC only)

*fineFTP does not support any kind of encryption. You should only use fineFTP in trusted networks.*

## Example

Using fineFTP in your application is simple. Just create an FtpServer object, add one or multiple users and start the server.

```cpp
#include <fineftp/server.h>
#include <thread>
 
int main() {
  // Create an FTP Server on port 2121. We use 2121 instead of the default port
  // 21, as your application would need root privileges to open port 21.
  fineftp::FtpServer ftp_server(2121);
 
  // Add the well known anonymous user. Clients can log in using username
  // "anonymous" or "ftp" with any password. The user will be able to access
  // your C:\ drive and upload, download, create or delete files. On Linux just
  // replace "C:\\" with any valid path. FineFTP is designed to be cross-platform.
  ftp_server.addUserAnonymous("C:\\", fineftp::Permission::All);
  
  // Start the FTP Server with a thread-pool size of 4.
  ftp_server.start(4);
 
  // Prevent the application from exiting immediately
  for (;;) std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
  return 0;
}
```

## How to checkout and build

There is an example project provided that will create an FTP Server at `C:\` (Windows) or `/` (Unix).

1. Install cmake and git / git-for-windows

2. Checkout this repo and the asio submodule
	```console
	git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/fineftp-server.git
	cd fineftp-server
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	```

3. CMake the project *(Building as debug will add some debug output that is helpful so see if everything is working)*
	```console
	mkdir _build
	cd _build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_install
	```

4. Build the project
	- Linux: `make`
	- Windows: Open `_build\fineftp.sln` with Visual Studio and build the example project

5. Start `fineftp_example` / `fineftp_example.exe` and connect with your favorite FTP Client (e.g. FileZilla) on port 2121 *(This port is used so you don't need root privileges to start the FTP server)*

## CMake Options

You can set the following CMake Options to control how fineFTP Server is built:

**Option**                       | **Type** | **Default** | **Explanation**                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FINEFTP_SERVER_BUILD_SAMPLES` | `BOOL` | `ON` | Build the fineFTP Server sample project.                                                                         |
| `FINEFTP_SERVER_BUILD_TESTS` | `BOOL` | `OFF` | Build the the fineftp-server tests. Requires C++17. For executing the tests, `curl` must be available from the `PATH`. |
| `FINEFTP_SERVER_USE_BUILTIN_ASIO`| `BOOL`| `ON` | Use the builtin asio submodule. If set to `OFF`, asio must be available from somewhere else (e.g. system libs). |
| `FINEFTP_SERVER_USE_BUILTIN_GTEST`| `BOOL`| `ON` <br>_(when building tests)_ | Use the builtin GoogleTest submodule. Only needed if `FINEFTP_SERVER_BUILD_TESTS` is `ON`. If set to `OFF`, GoogleTest must be available from somewhere else (e.g. system libs). |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` | `BOOL` |             | Not a fineFTP Server option, but use this to control whether you want to have a static or shared library.               |

## How to integrate in your project

### Option 1: Integrate as binaries

1. Download the latest release from the releases page or compile the binaries yourself.

2. Add the fineFTP Server directory to your `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`:

    ```shell
    cmake your_command_line -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/fineftp/install/dir
    ```

### Option 2: Integrate as source

1. Make the fineFTP Server directory available in your project. You can either add it as a git submodule, or use CMake FetchContent to download it.

2. Add it to your CMake Project:

    - **Either** by adding the top-level CMakeLists.txt to your project

        ```cmake
        add_subdirectory(path/to/fineftp-server)
        ```

        This which will inherit some behavior:

        - You can use the CMake options described below
        - You will get the asio version shipped with fineFTP
        - The debug / minsize / relwithdebinfo postfix will be set automatically


    - **Or** if you want to get a very clean version, which doesn't set any unnecessary options, include the `fineftp-server/server` subdirectory:

        ```cmake
        add_subdirectory(path/to/fineftp-server/server)
        ```

      You have to provide the required asio target on your own.

### Link against fineFTP Server

```cmake
find_package(fineftp REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE fineftp::server)
```
